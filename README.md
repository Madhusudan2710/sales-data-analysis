# Exploratory Data Analysis on Sales Data

## 📌 Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a sales dataset to uncover key trends, seasonal patterns, and performance metrics. The goal is to understand the factors that influence sales performance, such as top-selling products, seasonal demand fluctuations, and overall sales trends.

By analyzing this dataset, businesses can make data-driven decisions to optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and sales forecasting.

## 📊 Dataset: Sales Data
The dataset contains historical sales records, including details such as:

- **Order Date** (Timestamp of each sale)
- **Product Line** (Category of the product)
- **Quantity Ordered** (Number of units sold)
- **Sales Amount** (Revenue generated per order)
- **Customer Location** (Region of the purchase)
- **Price Each** (Unit price of the product)

This structured data allows us to analyze customer purchasing behavior, seasonal sales trends, and product performance.

## ✅ Tasks to Perform

### 1️⃣ Load and Clean the Sales Dataset
- Import the dataset using Pandas.
- Check for missing values, duplicate entries, or incorrect data types.
- Convert date columns to datetime format and create new features (e.g., Year, Month, Quarter).

### 2️⃣ Perform Summary Statistics and Exploratory Analysis
- Compute descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- Identify outliers in sales and pricing.
- Find the top-selling product lines and most profitable months.

### 3️⃣ Visualize Key Metrics
- **Sales Over Time:** Line chart showing monthly or quarterly sales trends.
- **Seasonal Analysis:** Identify peak sales periods using time-series analysis.
- **Top-Performing Products:** Bar charts showing sales by product category.
- **Customer Purchase Behavior:** Geographic sales distribution (if location data is available).

### 4️⃣ Document Insights
- Summarize key findings in a report or presentation.
- Highlight seasonal trends, sales growth patterns, and best-selling products.
- Provide business recommendations based on the insights.

## 📈 Expected Outcomes
✔ Clear understanding of sales trends over time.
✔ Identification of peak sales periods and seasonal patterns.
✔ Insights into customer preferences and top-performing products.
✔ Business recommendations based on data-driven findings.
